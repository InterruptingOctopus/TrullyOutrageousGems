this will be a list of the features i have planned for the mod:
-several gems: garnet, amethyst, pearl, topaz, peridot, ruby, saphire, beryl varients, several quartz varients,
-several uses for them based on culture and mythologies: amethyst prevents hangovers for instance, and is placed on goblets for example
-bezzeling gems onto weapons and armor
-tools CAN NOT be made into weapons and armor, unless another mod has recipies that do. this mod will not disable anything, at least not by default, but maybe in a config if players really want to disable gem tools. this aint gregtech.
-several cosmetic blocks and items, such as the alloy niello: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niello
-crafting system based off the zodiac, in which certain actions and events will be improved or only possible under one of the 12 signs.
-intergration with baubles to make rings n shid
-integration with tic to bezzle gems onto its tools?
-gem quality? akin to deepresonance's values or like agricraft's seed stats?
-grow gems from seeds similar to AE2's crystal seeds in water, but requiring more advanced methods for better quality
-gems will world gen not as ores, but as crystal models (by default, edited in config?). similar to thaumcraft 5's vishards, intangible's soul crystals, and deepresonance's crystals.
-override existing vanilla textures with my own[iron, gold, diamond, emerald blocks], disableable in config.
-new villager career called jeweler
-gemstone cutting, polishing, fitting, etc for *aesthetic*
-magnifying glass to see details of a gem
-and more to come!
